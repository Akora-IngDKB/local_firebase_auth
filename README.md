An experimental dart package that mocks (emulates) the [firebase_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth) plugin for quick and offline development.

> ## Intended to be used solely for development.

## Usage
1. Depend on the package by adding it to your pubspec.yaml dependencies.  
`local_firebase_auth: <latest_version>`


2. Import the library.
```dart
import 'package:local_firebase_auth/local_firebase_auth.dart';
```

When using this package alongside the official firebase plugin, it's advisable to import with a prefix to prevent conflict since it same class names except `LocalFirebaseAuth` (ofc :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:). Eg.  

```dart
import 'package:local_firebase_auth/local_firebase_auth.dart' as localAuth;
```


3. Be sure to initialize the package before using. **An exception will be raised if the package is not initialized before usage.**  
```dart
LocalFirebaseAuth.initialize('appName');
```


4. Use it as you would the official plugin.
For instance, you can create a new user as:  
```dart
final UserCredential result = await LocalFirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: email,
    password: pass,
);

final User user = result.user;
print(user.uid);
```

## Supported methods
Since this is a mock and experimental package, it is in no way meant as a replace for Firebase but for use quick and offline development use-cases.  
The following methods are currently available:  
| Method | Signature | Parameters |
